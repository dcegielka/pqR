The variant sequence operations that possibly return a range are used
here to speed up subscripting of vectors and matrices.  For matrices,
only the first index (for rows) is currently handled as a range (if
possible). (Handling the column index as a range would be possible,
but would provide a lesser speedup, due to data ordering, and to the
loop over columns being the outer loop.)

A missing row subscript for a matrix is also converted to a range from
1 to the number of rows.

Handling ranges without creating index vectors saves both time and
space.

Note that this change has no effect for accesses via compiled code,
though the compiler could probably be modified to exploit this
feature.
