Updates to use versions of recommended packages used in 2.15.1:

Changes are to use the following:

   MASS_7.3-18, mgcv_1.7-18, nlme_3.1.104, rpart_3.1-53, survival_2.36-14

mgcv is again tweaked to not force byte compilation

Did not update to new versions of Matrix and foreign, which were
modified for pqR to fix bugs, and had no substantive updates in the
versions for 2.15.1.
