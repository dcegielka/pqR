Puts back the lastsymenvnotfound feature, since symbits don't
replace it entirely due to environemnts with too many symbols.

Puts printname back in symbol (not symbol table hash entry), as 
not having it there slowed some operations.

Also uses symbits for more environments, including hashed ones.
