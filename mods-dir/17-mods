Various mods and documentation changes.  Some are related to
reliability, but are not actually bug fixes.

Extended the check for a foreign routine changing TRUE, FALSE, or NA
to .Call and .External (was only for .C and .Fortran).

Added a test helpers.R that checks that results of vector/matrix
operations are the same with or without multithreading/merging.

Added a "create-configure" script for creating "configure" from
"configure.ac".

Added more documentation on NAMED to R-exts.

Rewrote the INSTALL instructions.

Updated mods/README to give better instructions on how to produce
a release branch.
