Code movement.  May have performance impact, not just cosmetic, since
compiler can optimize calls within a file.

Move all code from logic.c into eval.c (deleting logic.c).
Move do_relop from relop.c into eval.c (R_relop stays in relop.c).

Move some code out of eval.c to builtin.c.

Other cosmetic changes.
