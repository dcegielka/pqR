Code movement.  May have performance impact, not just cosmetic, since
compiler can optimize calls within a file.

Move all code from logic.c into eval.c (deleting logic.c).
Move do_relop from relop.c into eval.c (R_relop stays in relop.c).

Move do_arith from arithemtic.c to eval.c, with some other mods, 
including removal of "probable complete loss of accuracy in modulus"
warning from myfmod.

Move some code out of eval.c to builtin.c.

Other cosmetic changes.
