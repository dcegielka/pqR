The BLAS routines supplied with R were modified to improve the
performance of the routines DGEMM (matrix-matrix multiply) and DGEMV
(matrix-vector multiply).  Also, proper propagation of NaN, Inf,
etc. is done now.

These routines are probably still not as fast as those in a more
sophisticated BLAS, but will be of benefit to users who do not 
install a different BLAS.
