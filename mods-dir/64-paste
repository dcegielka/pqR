Performance improvements to paste/paste0.

Speed up by changing .Internal interface, avoiding list(...), and
internally by having an array of string vectors rather than a pairlist,
plus not concatenating single things, and avoiding a big buffer for
collapse.

Created Rf_mkCharMulti to support paste; may have other uses.
