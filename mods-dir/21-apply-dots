Mods to avoid passing ... to functions called from the apply family
(apply, lapply, vapply, rapply, and eapply) when ... consists of nothing.

This reduces overhead, and sometimes will allow fast handling of
primitives in pqR (eg, sum).

Note that "apply" is in R, for which this may not help much, while
the others are in C.  

Also cleans up do_missing.
