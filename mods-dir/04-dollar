Access via the $ operator to lists, pairlists, and environments has
been sped up.  The speedup comes mainly from (a) avoiding the overhead
of calling DispatchOrEval if there are no complexities, (b) passing on
the field to extract as a symbol, or a name, or both, as available,
and then converting only as necessary, (c) using the new ep_match
functions instead of the previous local pstrmatch procedure, and (d)
not translating a string multiple times.

An error reporting bug in $ was also fixed.  See NEWS entry.
