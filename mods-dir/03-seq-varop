Several primitive functions that can generate integer sequences (":",
seq.int, seq_len, and seq_along) will now sometimes not generate an
actual sequence, but rather just a description of its start and end
points.  This is not visible to users (except in time and space
savings), but allows for speed up (with other mods) of primitive
operations such as "for" loops and indexing of vectors.
