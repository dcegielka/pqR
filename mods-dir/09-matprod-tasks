This mod implements matrix multiplication using tasks that may be done
in helper threads.

For real matrix multiplication, five tasks are defined, for
zero-result multiplies, matrix dot products, matrix-vector multiplies,
vector-matrix multiplies, and matrix-matrix multiplies.  All but the
first of these tasks have three versions, using non-taks routines in
extra/matprod, using BLAS routines, and using the pipelined task
routines in extra/matprod.

For complex matrix multiplication, two tasks are defined, for
zero-result and normal multiplies.

A new configuration option is introduced for controlling whether BLAS
routines can be called from helper threads (ie, whether the BLAS is
thread-safe), called --disable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-in-helpers.  The
default is to consider the BLAS to be thread-safe.
