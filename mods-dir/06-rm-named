A new function get_rm is now defined, which removes a variable and
returns the value it had had.  See the NEWS item and help(get_rm) for
details.

Many function in base have been changed to use get_rm to reduce
duplication of objects.  Some other code improvements have been
made at the same time.

Two bugs have been fixed, as reported in NEWS.

The lapack.Rout.save file has been changed to match the new behaviour
of svd regarding return of NULL elements.
