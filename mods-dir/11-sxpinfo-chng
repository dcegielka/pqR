This mod changes sxpinfo in a major way, splitting 32 of the 64 bits
into a union that differs for vector and non-vector nodes.  This
allows the full 32-bit truelength field to be restored.  The diverse
uses of the "misc" bit are now separated.  The use of the "trace" bit
for memory tracing is no longer possible, since it doesn't exist in
vectors, so the tracemem facility is defunct.
