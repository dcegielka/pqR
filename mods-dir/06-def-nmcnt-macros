Defines macros for using a three-bit nmcnt in the sxpinfo structure in
the header for every object rather than the named field of R-2.15.0.
These macros support a true reference counting scheme, which is
documented in R-ints.texi.  

New versions of NAMED and SET_NAMED are defined for compatibility.
The new macros are actually used only in later mods, not in this one.

The "inspect" and "pnamedcnt" funtions are updated to display nmcnt
properly.
