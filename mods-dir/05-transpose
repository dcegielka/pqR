The speed of the transpose (t) function has been improved, when
applied to real, integer, and logical matrices.  This is done by
moving pairs of elements, which improves memory access behaviour.

Note that I had previously speeded up transpose with a patch that was
incorporated into R 2.12.0.  This improvement gives an additional
speedup, by up to a factor of about 1.4.
