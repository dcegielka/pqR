Replace global hash table of symbol bindings with use of attrib field
in symbols for global binding (along with value field for base bindings).


This requires (silently) disallowing setting of attributes on symbols
at R level, which are not currently saved in a workspace in any case.
This is documented in NEWS, help(attr), and help(attributes).

New ATTRIB_W macro for internal use allows r/w access without such
checks, as needed for use for global bindings, or for efficiency.
