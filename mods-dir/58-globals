Replace global hash table of symbol bindings with use of attrib field
in symbols for global binding (along with value field for base bindings).

Requires (silently) disallowing setting of attributes on symbols at R
level, which are not currently saved in a workspace in any case.

New ATTRIB_W macro allows r/w access without such checks, as needed
for use for global bindings, or for efficiency.
