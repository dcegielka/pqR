Various inlined procedures were changed to be more efficient.

Several sets of types, represented by 32-bit words with "1" bits
corresponding to included types, are now defined in Rinternals.h. These
allow fast testing for set membership with if ((set >> type) & 1) ...
This is sed heavily in the inlined functions, but may also be used 
elsewhere.

The "length" function was un-inlined, since it's fairly long.
Numerous occurences of code like for (i = 0; i < length(...); i++)
... were replaced by code that doesn't call length many times,
sometimes by saving the result of one call of length, sometimes by
replacing length with LENGTH.  (Though note that LENGTH doesn't work
for R_NilValue!)
