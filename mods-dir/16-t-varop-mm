Creates VARIANT_TRANS, changes "t" to return it, and changes %*% to
ask for it for its operands, thereby allowing t(A)%*%B and A%*%t(B) 
to be done faster and with less memory use (like crossprod(A,B) and
tcrossprod(A,B)).

Also cleans up do_matprod, and fixes a bug.

Updates NEWS.Rd with info on this mod.
