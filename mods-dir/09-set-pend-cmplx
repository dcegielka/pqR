Changes symbol lookup routines to allow lookups that do not wait for
the value to be computed.  Also does some cleanup of these routines.

Modifies the implementation of assignments to use these modified
lookups, and to temporarily increment NAMEDCNT for rhs of complex
assignment to avoid problems when the value of the assignment
expression is used (see bug described in NEWS).  Adds a test of this.
