Improve performance when vectors are extended.

Done for length(vec) <- len.  Also now allow length(e) <- len when e
is an "expression".  Fix length(p) <- len when p is a pairlist/language object.

Done for [, [[, and $ as well.

Introduces new internal procedures getNamesAttrib and no_dim_attributes.
