Improve performance when vectors are extended.

Done for length(vec) <- len.  Also now allow length(e) <- len when e
is an "expression".  Fix length(p) <- len when p is a pairlist/language object.

Done for [, [[, and $ as well.

Extending names tries to be fast, but won't be, because NAMEDCNT gets
set to max elsewhere.
