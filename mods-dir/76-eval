Revise how the "evalv" function is written, along with the "EVALV"
macro, to reduce overheads and maybe make branch prediction work
better.

Improve performance of && and ||.

Also other performance improvements, including new SETCAR_NIL, etc.

Also fixes bug illustrated by f <- function (...) ..1(2); f(sqrt),
which previously produced an error rather than the square root of 2.
