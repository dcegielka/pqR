Revise how the "evalv" function is written, along with the "EVALV"
macro, to reduce overheads and maybe make branch prediction work
better.

New SETCAR_NIL, etc. and SETCAR_MACRO, etc.  Also revised SET_TAG.

Improve performance of && and ||.

Improve scalar real performance of relational ops, use VARIANT_ANY_ATTR
there and if "if" and "while".

Other performance improvements too.

Also fixes bug illustrated by f <- function (...) ..1(2); f(sqrt),
which previously produced an error rather than the square root of 2.
