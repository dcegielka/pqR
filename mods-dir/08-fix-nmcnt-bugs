Several bugs involving incorrect maintanence of NAMEDCNT/NAMED are
fixed here, as detailed in NEWS items.  These fixes use new macros
called SET_VECTOR_ELEMENT_TO_VALUE and SET_VECTOR_ELEMENT_FROM_VECTOR.
Some speed improvements were made too.

A new test script, tests/namedcnt.R, tests these fixes.
