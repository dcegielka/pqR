The "inspect" .Internal function was changed to show some details of
pairlist nodes, if SHOW_PAIRLIST_NODES is defined as 1 in inspect.c.
It also shows length and truelength (the hash) for CHARSXP nodes.
Optionally displays details of promises, and now handles R_UnboundSymbol
correctly.

Finally, it no longer produces output with tabs (spaces instead).
