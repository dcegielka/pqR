This mod uses the helpers framework to implement pipelined arithmetic
tasks, for operators +, -, *, /, ^, %%, and %/%, and for mathematical
functions of one argument (exp, etc.).  The code is also cleaned up in
various ways.

Note that some operations cannot be done in helper threads because of
the possibility that they will produce a warning message, which can be
produced only in the master thread.
