Adds defensive measures against argument abuse in .Call and .External,
by automatically duplicating and re-assigning the values of variables
that are atomic scalars with no attributes if they have NAMEDCNT > 1.

Also re-organizes stuff in dotcode.c, and handling of builtins in
eval.  .C, .Fortran, .Call, and .External are now "specials", and
evaluate their own arguments, and create their own contexts.

Somewhat motivated by the above changes, the 'methods' package now
uses new .Internals called get_slot.internal and set_slot.internal.
