Various performance tweaks.

Used saved data pointers in several routines - may help with compressed
pointers.

Improved any/all loops.

Improved subassign operations, especially with [[ and $, using VARIANT_FAST_SUB.
Also improved interfact to subscript.c, avoiding some NaN checks.

Put in special AVX code for some operations, used when AVX available,
which can be disabled by defining DISABLE_AVX_CODE.

Revised ISNAN checks.

Improved logicalSubscript for recycling cases.
