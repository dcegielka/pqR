Replaces the previously-used garbage collector with one using sggc.

Information about this is in NEWS, R-admin, R-exts, and R-ints.

Got rid of --enable-strict-barrier, which is not needed in pqR to make
CAR(x)=y illegal.  The PROTECTCHECK aspect of it may be reintroduced
later.

Also fixes the problem of manual cross-references going to wrong
versons at r-project.org (noted in NEWS).

Changed how hashing for symbols works, may be desirable to
change suppression of serialization of gp bit 1...

Fixed following bug (crash), arising from "identify" was returning C NULL
sometimes - changed to R NULL:

a<-.Internal(identify(numeric(0),numeric(0),character(1),1,TRUE,0.5,0.25,FALSE))
