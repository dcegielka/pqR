Replaces the previously-used garbage collector with one using sggc.

Information about this is in NEWS, R-admin, R-exts, and R-ints.

Also fixes the problem of manual cross-references going to wrong
versons at r-project.org (noted in NEWS).

Changed how hashing for symbols works, may be desirable to
change suppression of serialization of gp bit 1...

Fixed following bug (crash), arising from "identify" was returning C NULL
sometimes - changed to R NULL:

a<-.Internal(identify(numeric(0),numeric(0),character(1),1,TRUE,0.5,0.25,FALSE))
