The "rbind", "cbind", "c", and "unlist" primitives have been speeded
up for many cases.  A bug in "rbind" has been fixed, as documented in
a NEWS item.

A new copy_elements_coerced procedure numeric and string vectors with
possible coercion, and has been used to replace much repetitive code
that does this.  This replaces the copy_numeric_or_string_elements
procedure from the 04-coerce-bind mod.
