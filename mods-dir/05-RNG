Improves the performance of the uniform random number generation
routines (which are also used as the base for other generators), and
an unnecessary limitation.  See NEWS entry for details.

The previous code was also rather messy - global references were mixed
with references by argument to the same variables, sometimes concealed
by macro definitions, and the seed was often referenced by pointers
which actually always pointed to the same location, which was also in
some places referenced directly.

A bit of previous code that assumed R integers are exactly 32 bits was
changed to assume only an R integer is at least 32 bits in size.
