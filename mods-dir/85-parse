Modifications to parser to fix the problem of outer-level "else" being
rejected when sourcing a file (or parsing from file or text variable, or
in Rscript).  Also --peek-for-else option to control this in other 
contexts.

Other parsing cleanup as well.  Also slight performance tweak to getOptions.
