Put in some collation stuff from later R Core releases, both for
features, and for performance improvement.

Includes putting ICU in "capabilities()", the new icuGetCollate function,
and changes to icuSetCollate.

Also improvement to looping in string_relop, and stash pointer to
improve performance with compressed pointers.
