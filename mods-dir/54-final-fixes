Some final fixes for release compatible with 2.15.1.

Fixed bug introduced in 2.15.1 with utf8toucs returning size_t but
indicating error by negative value.  Fixed some similar problems with
mbcstowc, but the problem is pervasive in the character coding
routines, and partly originates in external libraries.

Fixed problems with missing argument introduced in pqR-2016-06-24.
For instance 

   f <- function (x) x;  g <- function (y) f(y);  g()

failed to give an error.  Added more tests.

Also, fixed lack of error from

   f <- function (x) { names(x) <- c("a","b"); x }; f()

Fixed problem with complex arithmetic, illustrated by

   a <- 1:10; b <- (1:10)+0i; a-b

The fix also speeds up arithmetic with mixed complex and real/integer
operands.

Fixed help on ** operator.
