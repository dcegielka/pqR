Fixes a memory expansion bug reported to R Core (PR 15363), and the
similar problem with rm and get_rm.  Also cleans up the code some
(more cleanup is needed), and uses HASHASH to avoid hash computations
consistently.  Defines a maximum size for the string hash table in
memory.c separately from the maximum size for other hash tables.
