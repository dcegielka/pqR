Logical operations and relational operators have been sped up in
simple cases, and use the new facility for producing a scalar logical
result without allocating new storage.  Relational operators have also
been substantially speeded up for long vectors.  Relational operators
are reduced to either EQOP or LTOP to avoid repetitive code, which
then makes it reasonable to specially treat equal length operands and
operands of length 1.
