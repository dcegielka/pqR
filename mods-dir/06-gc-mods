Many changes were made to the garbage collector and associated
routines in memory.c.  These do not change the general scheme, but
improve it in many ways, some of which are noted below.

Small nodes classes are now distinguished only by size, with CONS
cells being allocated in the smallest class that can contain a CONS
cell, not in a special class.  (Depending on the machine, it is
possible for some vector objects to be smaller than CONS cells.)  See
comments in memory.c for details, also the new version of the
documentation obtained with help(Memory).

Linking of nodes in pages is now done in forward order, not backwards
as before, which should improve cache performance.

The source file size.c has been merged into memory.c, where it
logically belongs.

The mkChar function and related routines were moved from envir.c to
memory.c, where they belong, because of the special treatment of the
global string cache by the garbage collector.

HASHPRI was renamed to HASHSLOTSUSED.

The scheme for using valgrind was revised, and a newer version of
valgrind is now used.

The gc.time function was fixed (see NEWS item).
