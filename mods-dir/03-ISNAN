IF ENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK is defined when pqR is configured (by including
-DENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK in CFLAGS), the ISNAN macro is changed to be
faster for many common cases.  This change relies on the same result
being produced when casting NaN, -NaN, NA, and -NA to integer, which
is true on Intel systems, but not on SPARC systems.  A fatal error is
produced if this is seen to not be true (in which case the define of
ENABLE_ISNANS_TRICK should of course be removed).
