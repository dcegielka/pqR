Many uses of NAMED and SET_NAMED are replaced by the appropriate
NAMEDCNT macro (defined in the 07-def-nmcnt-macros mod).

Procedures for setting variables in envir.c have been re-organized,
and changed to increment and decrement NAMEDCNT according to the new
scheme.

The <<- operator no longer duplicates rather than adjusting NAMEDCNT
when the value assigned has NAMEDCNT > 0.

Assignment to a global symbol no longer causes it to be flushed from
the global cache, unless it did not previously exist.  (Flushing is
not necessary when all that changes is the value bound, not whether
and where it is bound.)

The count of hash table entries in use was wrongly maintained in
HashSet in envir.c.  This affected when hash tables were resized, but
not correctness.
