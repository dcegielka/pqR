Extending lists and character vectors by assigning to an index past
the end, deleting list items by assigning NULL, and concatenation of
character vectors with "c" have all been speded up.  This is partially
from use of copy_string_elements and copy_vector_elements.  Another
gain comes from handling deletion of a contiguous block specially.
