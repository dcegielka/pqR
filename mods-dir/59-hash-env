Changes regarding hashed environments.

Minimum size of hash table now depends on pointer size/type.
Now expands by factors of two.

Default env size is now NA (internal default).

Hash for environemnts in SYM_HASH(symbol) is now taken from CHAR_HASH
of printname, treated as unsigned.  When used, shifted right one, so
top bit is zero (positive) for arithmetic, but all bits are present so
SYM_HASH can be used for searching for symbol entry in symbol table.
