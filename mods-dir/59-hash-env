Changes regarding hashed environments.

Minimum size of hash table now depends on pointer size/type.  Now
expands by factors of two.

Default env size is now NA (internal default).

Hash for environemnts in SYM_HASH(symbol) is now taken from CHAR_HASH
of printname.  CHAR_HASH/SYM_HASH now only 31 bits, so signed/unsigned
not an issue.

Serialization converts to old hash scheme on write, and to the new
hash scheme on read, for backcompatibility both ways.
