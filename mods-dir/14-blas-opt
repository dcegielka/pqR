Further improvements in the reference BLAS routines.

DSYRK improved, which affects performance of R crossprod and tcrossprod.

DGEMM is improved for all cases except when the first but not second
operand is tranposed.

Also fixes the bug illustrate below:

  a <- matrix(c(NA,1,0,1),2,2,byrow=T)
  print(a%*%t(a))
  print(tcrossprod(a,a))
  print(tcrossprod(a))
