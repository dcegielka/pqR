This mod revises doc/NEWS.Rd to be in pretty form for a release,
removing some information that really only belongs in MODS.

The MODS file is also removed here.  It was present before only
because earlier version of some mods used it rather than the mods
directory.  (However, MODS is recreated in release directories.)
