Defines several functions for use within the R interpreter.

New functions copy_string_elements and copy_vector_elements are now
defined.  Compared to using SET_STRING_ELT and SET_VECTOR_ELT, these
allow copying of multiple elements without error checks on every
element, and sometimes without old-to-new checks on every element.

A new function copy_elements is also defined, for copying elements in
any sort of vector (duplicating non-atomic elements, and using
copy_string_elements).

A new function set_elements_to_NA_or_NULL is defined for doing that.
