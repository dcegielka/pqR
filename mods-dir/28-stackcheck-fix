Fixes a problem with checking for C stack overflow, which occurred
when the fallback method was needed for determining the start of the
stack, and a stack check was made when very little stack was used
(which was incorrectly diagnosed as stack overflow).  Occurred in the
check for the Matrix package when using gcc on SPARC Solaris, after
pqR was changed to reduce stack usage.

Also cleaned up the relevant code in other ways.
