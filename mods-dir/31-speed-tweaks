Tweaks in various places to speed things up.

Defines FINDFUN macro for use in eval, to often avoid overhead
of calling findFun.

New faster version of the string hash function.

Faster indexing with [[ when index is a vector of numbers (avoids
creating names attribute).  Used in base::apply now, so speeds it up.
