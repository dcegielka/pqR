PROTECT, UNPROTECT, etc. have been made mostly macros in most of the
files in src/main.  This applies only to files that include Defn.h
after defining the symbol USE_FAST_PROTECT_MACROS.  If this is
defined, macros PROTECT2 and PROTECT3 for protecting two or three
objects at once are also defined.

This change speeds up numerous operations.
