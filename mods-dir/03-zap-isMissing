Removes a call of R_isMissing in the interpeter's evalList function.
This check, done for every argument to a builtin primitive that is a
symbol, is slow, and appears to serve only to produce an error message
that is slightly different (and sometimes less informative) than
simply letting the symbol be evaluated.
