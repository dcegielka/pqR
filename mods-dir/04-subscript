Speeds up extraction and replacement of subsets of vectors or
matrices, by speeding up the creation of the vector of indexes used.
Often avoids a duplication and eliminates a second scan of the
subscript vector for zero subscripts, folding it into a previous scan
at no additional cost.  String subscripts are handled more efficiently
by not creating a vector of indexnames when it is not needed, and by
other detailed code improvements.

The previous code duplicated a vector of indexes when it seems
unnecessary.  Duplication was for two reasons: first, to handle the
situation where the index vector is itself being modified in a replace
operation, and second, so that any attributes can be removed, which is
helpful only for string subscripts, given how the routine to handle
them returns information via an attribute.  Duplication for the second
reasons can easily be avoided.  The first reason for duplication is
sometimes valid, but can usually be avoided by, first, only doing it
if the subscript is to be used for replacement rather than extraction,
and second, only doing it if the NAMED field for the subscript isn't
zero.

Also removes two layers of procedure call overhead (passing seven
arguments, so not trivial) that seemed to be doing nothing.
