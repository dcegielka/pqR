Procedures copy_1_string, copy_2_strings, and copy_3_strings are now
defined in utils.c, and used in many places in the interpreter.  These
procedures concatenate 1, 2, or 3 strings, checking for overflow of
the destination space.  They are faster and less error-prone than the
various code sequences they replace (often involving strlen and sprintf).
This gives signficant speed-ups for some operations such as calling
S3 methods.
