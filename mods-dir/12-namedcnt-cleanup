This mod documents a set of conventions regarding modification of
objects and use of NAMEDCNT in R-ints, and implements changes that
bring pqR closer to following them.  These changes also fix bugs,
generalize operations, and improve performance by avoiding some
duplications.

The KalmanLike and KalmanFore functions were also changed to not
modify shared objects, even if "fast" is TRUE.  This was necessitated
by other changes that broadened when objects are shared.

More types are compatible for [[<-, such as assigning a raw to a real,
and a function to an expression.

The bugs fixed include pqR issues #14 and #15, and all of #16 except
about printing dimnames, which also occur in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.1.
Also makes illegal constructs like v <- pairlist(1,2,3); v[[-2]] <- NULL,
which are documented to be illegal.
