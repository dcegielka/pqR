This mod implements the basic framework of the helpers facility.
However, the only functions that may be done in a task are the "row"
and "col" functions (implemented in this mod for testing purposes).
Later mods implement many more operations as tasks that may be done in
helper threads.

General information on the helpers facility is now obtainable with
help(helpers).  In this mod, the information is very minimal.

The --enable-helpers-threads configuration option is now documented
in R-admin.texi.

There is some minimal documentation on the helpers framework in
R-ints.texi.

See NEWS item (and R --help) for new use of environment variables as
alternative to arguments to the R command.
