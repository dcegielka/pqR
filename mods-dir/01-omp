Rinternals.h now has a #define for R_OMP_FIRSTPRIVATE_VARS, which
contains a comma-separated list of variables that should usually be
included in the firstprivate part of an OMP parallel construction,
since they are used in macros such as NA_REAL.

The only use of this in the interpreter itself gets deleted by a later
mod, but this mod is retained anyway...
