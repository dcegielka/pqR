Modify sxpinfo structure, primarily to allow fetching of type,
pending, non-scalar, and has-attribute bits as a single byte, for
quickly checking all of these.  Eval and other things changed to
exploit this.

Also at one point (still in the git history) eliminated setting of
attributes on primitive functions, but after second thoughts this has
been reverted (maybe should instead make this actually work properly,
with duplicate making a copy of a primitive object).
