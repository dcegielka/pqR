Modify sxpinfo structure, primarily to allow fetching of type,
pending, non-scalar, and has-attribute bits as a single byte, for
quickly checking all of these.  Eval and other things changed to
exploit this.

Fix things so that NA_LOGICAL and NA_INTEGER are constants in
the inlined functions of Rinlinedfuns.h.

Also at one point (still in the git history) eliminated setting of
attributes on primitive functions, but after second thoughts this has
been reverted (maybe should instead make this actually work properly,
with duplicate making a copy of a primitive object).
