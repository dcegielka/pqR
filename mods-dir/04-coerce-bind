Extensive cleanup in bind.c and coerce.c.

Simple cases of "c" with no names (or names ignored), no conversion,
and no recursion are done more quickly.

The copy_elements procedure is now used where appropriate.

A complete set of XFromY functions are now present in coerce.c (some
were missing).  A copy_numeric_or_string_elements procedure is now
defined in coerce.c, which uses these functions.

Also, fixed a bug where excess warning messages may be produced on
conversion to RAW.  See NEWS entry.
