Improvements to package loading, other startup time issues.

Increased initial symbol hash table size from 8K to 16K.

Got rid of occurrences of 29L w.r.t. hash table sizes.

Also introduces minlength argument for memory.profile

Includes a first attempt at not always duplicating attributes when
assigning them, rather conservative, in hopes that this may reduce
duplication of things like scalar strings at startup.
