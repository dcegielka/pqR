Improvements to package loading, other startup time issues, which
have veered off into distantly-related changes.

Increased initial symbol hash table size from 8K to 16K.

Got rid of occurrences of 29L w.r.t. hash table sizes.

Also introduces minlength argument for memory.profile

Includes attempts at not always duplicating attributes when assigning
them, rather conservative, in hopes that this may reduce duplication
of things like scalar strings at startup, and also for class
attributes.

Applys the usual kludge to get @<- to not increment NAMEDCNT.
