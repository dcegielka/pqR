Replace the special flag for symbols like +, -, etc. by a more general
method of quickly determining that some symbols do not have a binding
in an environment.  Removes the "last symbold not found" facility,
which should be largely superceded by this change.

Fixed bug: a <- as.integer(NA); e <- new.env(size=a); print(a)
