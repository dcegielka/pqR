An "eval" of an expression that evaluates to itself (usually a
constant in an expression) has been made faster by quickly checking
for a self-evaluating value by a shift and mask operation, and if the
expression is self-evaluating, returning it immediately, without the
overhead of things like checking for stack overflow.  Depending on the
machine and the compiler, it's possible that the subsequent switch on
expresssion type for non-self-evaluating expressions will also be
faster, due to it having many fewer cases.
