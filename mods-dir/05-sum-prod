Code for the sum and prod functions has been changed to move some
checks outside the inner summation loops.  The effect depends on the
extent to which the unnecessary checks overlap memory fetch
operations, but one would expect signficant speed-ups with some
machines/compilers.

I had previously proposed this modificaton to sum and prod before
R-2.12.0.  That patch was not adopted by the R core team, though they
did swap the order of checking for NA/NaN and checking the na.rm
option, which avoids the worst inefficiency of the previous code in
R-2.11.1.
