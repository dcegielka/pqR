## THIS IS THE VERSION FOR 64-BIT BUILDS ON A 64-BIT WINDOWS SYSTEM.
##
## Edit as needed locally, putting the modified vesion in MkRules.local,
## or just copy this version unchanged to MkRules.local.
##
## Use MkRules.dist as a starting point if you are doing a 32-bit build.
##
## You'll have to customize this yourself for a 32-bit build on 64-bit Windows.


## This is only used when building R itself but it does customize
## etc/*/Makeconf using LOCAL_SOFT, BINPREF[64], IMPLIB and R_ARCH
