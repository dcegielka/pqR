This distribution contains the sources to build pqR on Windows.  See
the file `README' for fuller details (written for R-2.15.0, but
generally applicable to pqR).

Details on building pqR are given in the `R Installation and
Administration Manual' in the doc/manual directory.  An HTML version
is at doc/html/R-admin.html, unless you're using a development version
of pqR (from github).

The short version of these instructions, which may not always be
adequate, is as follows:

  1) Obtain the pqR source from pqR-project.org, and untar it to
     create a source directory.  (This assume you already have a tar
     program.  If not, create an empty source directory, go on
     to step (2), and then come back here, redoing steps (1) and (2)
     with the real source directory.)

  2) Obtain Rtools215.exe distibuted at r-project.org (or get it
     from http:pqR-project.org/Rtools215.exe).  Run this to install
     the required tools, choosing options appropriate for either
     a 32-bit or 64-bit build, and specifying the source directory
     you created in step (1) for the destination.

  3) Obtain TeX from somewhere, such as http://miktex.org.  (If you
     get the basic MiKTeX version, note that it will at times ask
     about downloading more parts of TeX, and that this may result
     in the build process appearing to hang if the window that MiKTeX
     puts up asking about this is covered by another window.)

  4) Start a Windows Console window, and change to the src/gnuwin32
     sub-directory of the source directory your created at step (1).

  5) Copy either MkRules.dist or MkRules.dist64 to MkRules.local
     and possibly edit MkRules.local as appropriate.

  6) Possibly edit the options (eg, whether helper threads are
     enabled) at the start of fixed/h/config.h (in src/gnuwin32).

  7) Issue the following commands (in a Windows console window), which
     will build pqR in-place in the source directory.

          mkdir c:/tmp
          set TMPDIR=c:/tmp
          set CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning
          make all recommended
          cd bitmap
          make

   8) You should now be able to run Rterm.exe, which is located in 
      <build-dir>/bin/<arch>, where <build-dir> is the source/build
      directory you are using and <arch> is i386 for 32-bit builds
      and x64 for 64-bit builds.

      The number of helper threads to use can be specified by 

          set R_HELPERS=<number>

      before running Rterm.      

Note that the Windows GUI is a separate program, which is not
discussed here.
