Miscellaneous changes.

Replaced can_save_alloc with alloc_or_reuse.

Clean up R_LookupMethod and its uses.

Introduce and use installed_already.

Convert some eval's to forcePromise's.

Fiddle with use of forcePromise vs. forcePromisePendingOK, and
eliminate duplicate code in these two functions.

Changed a reference in "methods" to R_NilValue that should be
to R_EmptyEnv.

Merges LISTSXP, LANGSXP, and DOTSXP code in duplicate1.  No
longer duplicates top-level attributes twice.

Fixed the following bug (where the last stmt failed with an error):

   p <- pairlist(1,2,3,4); dim(p) <- c(2,2); p[1,1] <- 9

Cleaned up now-unused "variant" in subassign.c.

Moved some (not all) remaining do_ declarations from names.c
to other source files.

Changed tuning parameters for GC, and introduced supplemental
criterion based on recent allocation sizes for setting R_VSize.
