Set "prev" field in nodes to zero to indicate that they are
already in an old-to-new list, and hence don't have to be
moved again.

Also, gets rid of error checks on first arg of SETCAR, SETCDR, etc.,
which seem redundant, given that a memory access error will result.

Makes SETCAR a macro in the interpreter, so a call can be avoided
when the node is already in the old-to-new list.
