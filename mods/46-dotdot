Implement the .. operator, as a better version of :

Also fix bug where 0x1.2.3 gave no error, and bug where "i" and "L"
didn't end up in parse data in "1i" and "1L".

Allow real constants like 0x1.8 (equal to 1.5), which are inexplicably
disallowed in R Core versions.  (Previously allowed but with . ignored
in pqR.)  Also allow this for input from 'scan', etc.

Updates R-lang.texi and several help files to document .. (and fix a
few other things).

Introduce pqR_extensions option, currently with default FALSE (but
meant to switch to TRUE once setting for packages is implemented).
