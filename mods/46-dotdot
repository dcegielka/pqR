Implement the .. operator, as a better version of :

Also fix bug where 0x1.2.3 gave no error, and bug where "i" and "L"
didn't end up in parse data in "1i" and "1L".

Allow real constants like 0x1.8 (equal to 1.5), which are inexplicably
disallowed in R Core versions.  (Previously allowed but with . ignored
in pqR.)  Also allow this for input from 'scan', etc.

Updates R-lang.texi and several help files to document .. (and fix a
few other things).

Introduce parse_dotdot option, defaulting to TRUE, but which can
be overridden with R_PARSE_DOTDOT environment variable.

Make "unique" not append a separator when the name already ends with it.
This avoids creation of invalid names with parse_dotdot is TRUE.
