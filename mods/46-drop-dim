Implement suppression of dimension dropping when
a numeric subscript has a 1D dim attribute.

Fixed bug illustrated by 

  b <- array(c(3),dimnames=list(xyz=c("fred")))
  attr(b,"fred") <- 1
  print(b[1])
  print(b[])  # should print same thing

Except as special kludge to keep packages working, have
b[,drop=FALSE] return a duplicate of b, as before (keeping
dimensions and attribues).

Fixed bug (also fixed in R Core) illustrated by

  a <- array(c(3,4),dimnames=list(xyz=c("fred","bert")))
  print(a[1:2])
  print(a[])  # should print same thing
