Miscellaneous bug fixes.

Fixed a lack of protection bug in "log" when it produced a warning.

Fixed an out-of-bound memory access in chull that valgrind reports 
(but which is likely to be innocuous).

Fixed bug in "foreign" package that showed up on systems where
the C "char" type is unsigned.

Fixed stack imbalance bug in assignment to arrays with zero-length
subscripts.

Fixed problem with news() due to pqR version numbers being dates.

Changed the internet.R test to avoid looking at CRAN's html code,
which is subject to change.  Looks instead at a test file at 
pqR-project.org.

Fixed argument error checking bugs in gevents.c.

Fixed problems in reg-tests-1b test script, related to making it
fail gracefully on systems without enough memory for xz compression.
Included a reg-tests-1b.Rout.save to compare with.

Fix bug with lang[23456] not protecting all its arguments.  Also
clean up code (no bug) for list[2345].

Fixed bugs (also in R Core versions) with lack of protection in
sort.c and deriv.c.
