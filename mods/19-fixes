Miscellaneous bug fixes.

Fixed a lack of protection bug in "log" when it produced a warning.

Fixed an out-of-bound memory access in chull that valgrind reports 
(but which is likely to be innocuous).

Fixed bug in "foreign" package that showed up on systems where
the C "char" type is unsigned.

Fixed stack imbalance bug in assignment to arrays with zero-length
subscripts.
