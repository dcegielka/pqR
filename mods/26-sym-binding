Implement a scheme to save the last finding found for a symbol in an
unhashed environment in the SEXPREC for the symbol (two new fields).
This may usually avoid linear searches for symbols in local environments.

Also (sometimes) records in each symbol the last (usually) unhashed
environment in which it was NOT found, to speed up failing searches
(on the way to a global binding).  Currently records and looks at the
environment of the failed search only when searching for a function,
only for an unhashed environment, and only if the function is
eventually found someplace (or is for an S3 method).

Defines new findVarInFramePendingOK function.
