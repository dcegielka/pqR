Modifications to how scalars (vectors of length one) are handled.

Introduces two versions:  ScalarReal and ScalarRealShared, etc.
Many uses in interpreter converted to shared versions.

No longer inlines these, except except ScalarLogicalShared.

Defines R_NilValue as a constant, rather than allocate it at the start.
Created a new const-objs.c source file for such constant objects.

Makes the logical constants be constant objects.

Makes real 0 and 1 be constant objects when created with ScalarRealShared.

Makes "rep" always return an unshared object.

Fixed a bug in numericDeriv that was found as a result of failure after
real constants were created.

Make R_EmptyEnv a constant.
