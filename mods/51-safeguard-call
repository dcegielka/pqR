Adds defensive measures against argument abuse in .Call and .External,
by automatically duplicating and re-assigning the values of variables
that are atomic scalars with no attributes if they have NAMEDCNT > 1.

Also re-organizes stuff in dotcode.c, and handling of builtins in
eval.  .C, .Fortran, .Call, and .External are now "specials", and
evaluate their own arguments, and create their own contexts.
