More definition and use of the scalar constants.

Serialize/unserialize now use a flag to indicate a constant, which
is restored as the same constant.

Other optimization also done in serialize.c, including eliminating
tail recursion in ReadItem.

Define one-element pairlist constants.

Modifed matchArgs as a result to avoid writing to supplied arg list,
which might be a read-only constant.
