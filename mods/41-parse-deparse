Mods to the new parser and deparser.  The new parser now replaces the
old parser.

ReplIteration has been changed to no longer employ a horrible kludge
regarding semicolons, and otherwise be more sane.  Its interface is
different than previously.

The ->, ->>, and ** operators are now real operators.  This fixes the
following error reporting bug:

  > a + ** 2
  Error: unexpected '^' in "a + **"

Changes deparsing of complex numbers, so that the following no longer
happens:

  > deparse(quote(3*5i))
  [1] "3 * (0+5i)"

with the result instead being "3 * 5i".

Introduced the keep.parens option.

Now fixes these bugs mentioned in mods/40-deparse:

  > deparse(parse(text="a = b <- c")[[1]])  # Puts in unnecessary parens
  [1] "a = (b <- c)"
  > deparse(parse(text="a+!b")[[1]])        # Puts in unnecessary parens
  [1] "a + (!b)"
  > deparse(quote(`+`(1,2) %fred% 4))       # Omits necessary parens
  [1] "1 + 2 %fred% 4"
  > deparse(parse(text="?lm")[[1]])         # Doesn't know about ? operator
  [1] "`?`(lm)"
  > deparse(parse(text="a:=b")[[1]])        # Doesn't know about := operator
  [1] "`:=`(a, b)"

Corrected documentation on the = assignment operator.
