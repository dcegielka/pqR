Miscellaneous fixes.

Fixed INSTALL doc file.

Fixes problem of variant field for fast ops not being big enough,
that disabled part of the static box optimizations.  Also cleaned
up unused fields.

Added a bit more use of static boxes (result of length, arg of
seq_len, conditions for if and while).

Moved some more error messages out of "eval" and related functions,
just in case this helps cache or other code aspects in time-critical
code.

Updates R-ints for current SEXPREC layout.

Tweaks to mods/README and INSTALL.

Fixed protect bug in promiseArgs.
