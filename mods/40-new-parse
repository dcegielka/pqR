New parser implementation, using recursive descent rather than bottom-up
bison parser.  Accessible with "newparse", old one still used otherwise.

Removes parens from all expressions except those one right side of 
a formula (~).  This will need to change later to removing only necessary
parens.

Allows "else" on new line in expressions read from file (unlike old parse).

Bug to fix here:

  > p <- parse()
  ?"abc;xyz"
  Error in parse() : 1:1: unexpected INCOMPLETE_STRING
  1: "abc;

  > p <- parse()
  ? 8 # dc;dd
  Error in parse() : 1:8: unexpected end of input
  1:  8 # dc;
