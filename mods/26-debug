Fixes and speedups for debugging.

Fixes the following bug:

  g <- function () { A <<- A+1; function (x) x+1 }
  f <- function () (g())(10)
  
  A <- 0; f(); print(A)
  
  debug(f);
  A <- 0; f(); print(A)
  
in which stepping though f after debug(f) results in A having the 
value 2 rather than 1.

Now looks at deparse.max.lines when exitting debug of a function
as well as when entering.  Also, execClosure has parallel code
to applyclosure, though it's not clear that it is ever executed.
