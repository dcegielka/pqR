Changes taken from R-2.15.1.

Put in the (minor) changes in the "grid" package from 2.15.1, except
for the Polish translations.

Fix for is.unsorted from 2.15.1, in base/R/sort.R, NEWS from 2.15.1 is:

      is.unsorted() gave incorrect results on non-atomic objects such
      as data frames.  (Reported by Matthew Dowle.)

Took entire splines package from 2.15.1.  This includes new feature
described in 2.15.1 NEWS as

      splineDesign() and spline.des() in package splines have a new
      option sparse which can be used for efficient construction of a
      sparse B-spline design matrix (_via_ Matrix).
