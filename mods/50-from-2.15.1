Changes taken from R-2.15.1.

Put in the (minor) changes in the "grid" package from 2.15.1, except
for the Polish translations.

Fix for is.unsorted from 2.15.1, in base/R/sort.R, NEWS from 2.15.1 is:

      is.unsorted() gave incorrect results on non-atomic objects such
      as data frames.  (Reported by Matthew Dowle.)

Took entire splines package from 2.15.1.  This includes new feature
described in 2.15.1 NEWS as

      splineDesign() and spline.des() in package splines have a new
      option sparse which can be used for efficient construction of a
      sparse B-spline design matrix (_via_ Matrix).

Made change from 2.15.1 described in NEWS as follows:

      source() now uses withVisible() rather than
      .Internal(eval.with.vis).  This sometimes alters tracebacks
      slightly.

Small fix to tcltk/src/tcltk.c from 2.15.1.

Changes to parallel to incorporate mods from 2.15.1, including those 
corresponding to these NEWS entries:

      In package parallel, makeForkCluster() and the multicore-based
      functions use native byte-order for serialization 

      In package parallel, clusterApply() and similar failed to handle
      a (pretty pointless) length-1 argument. (PR#14898)

Performance improvement from R-2.15.1 with NEWS as follows:

      tabulate() makes use of .C(DUP = FALSE) and hence does not copy
      bin.  (Suggested by Tim Hesterberg.)  It also avoids making a
      copy of a factor argument bin.

All of 'graphics' package taken from 2.15.1, which does the following
from 2.15.1 NEWS file:

      The plot() and Axis() methods for class "table" now respect
      graphical parameters such as cex.axis.  (Reported by Martin
      Becker.)

      In legend(), setting some entries of lwd to NA was inconsistent
      (depending on the graphics device) in whether it would suppress
      those lines; now it consistently does so.  (PR#14926)

Took entire stats4 package from 2.15.1, but only change is adding
Polish translations.

Check of argument length in seq (already done for seq.int), described
in 2.15.1 NEWS as

      Nonsense uses such as seq(1:50, by = 5) (from package plotrix)
      and seq.int(1:50, by = 5) are now errors.

Fix of mkChar and mkCharCE from 2.15.1, described as

      C entry points mkChar and mkCharCE now check that the length of
      the string they are passed does not exceed 2^31-1 bytes: they
      used to overflow with unpredictable consequences.

Took base/R/merge.R and base/man/merge.Rd from R-3.1.1, except deleted
large vector stuff.  Updated tests in reg-tests-1b.R and .save.
Implements bug fix from 2.15.1:
      More cases in which merge() could create a data frame with
      duplicate column names now give warnings.  Cases where names
      specified in by match multiple columns are errors.
And new feature from 3.0.0:
      merge() works in more cases where the data frames include
      matrices.  (Wish of PR#14974.)

Took base/R/kappa.r from R-2.15.1, which has implementation of matrix
2-norm mentioned in 2.15.1 NEWS.
