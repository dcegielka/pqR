Changes taken from R-2.15.1.

Put in the (minor) changes in the "grid" package from 2.15.1, except
for the Polish translations.

Fix for is.unsorted from 2.15.1, in base/R/sort.R, NEWS from 2.15.1 is:

      is.unsorted() gave incorrect results on non-atomic objects such
      as data frames.  (Reported by Matthew Dowle.)
