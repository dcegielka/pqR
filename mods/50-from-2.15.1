Changes taken from R-2.15.1.

Put in the (minor) changes in the "grid" package from 2.15.1, except
for the Polish translations.

Fix for is.unsorted from 2.15.1, in base/R/sort.R, NEWS from 2.15.1 is:

      is.unsorted() gave incorrect results on non-atomic objects such
      as data frames.  (Reported by Matthew Dowle.)

Took entire splines package from 2.15.1.  This includes new feature
described in 2.15.1 NEWS as

      splineDesign() and spline.des() in package splines have a new
      option sparse which can be used for efficient construction of a
      sparse B-spline design matrix (_via_ Matrix).

Made change from 2.15.1 described in NEWS as follows:

      source() now uses withVisible() rather than
      .Internal(eval.with.vis).  This sometimes alters tracebacks
      slightly.

Small fix to tcltk/src/tcltk.c from 2.15.1.

Changes to parallel to incorporate mods from 2.15.1, including those 
corresponding to these NEWS entries:

      In package parallel, makeForkCluster() and the multicore-based
      functions use native byte-order for serialization 

      In package parallel, clusterApply() and similar failed to handle
      a (pretty pointless) length-1 argument. (PR#14898)

Performance improvement from R-2.15.1 with NEWS as follows:

      tabulate() makes use of .C(DUP = FALSE) and hence does not copy
      bin.  (Suggested by Tim Hesterberg.)  It also avoids making a
      copy of a factor argument bin.
