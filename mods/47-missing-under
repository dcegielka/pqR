Implements '_' as an explicit missing value, and its
use to signal that a diminsion should not be dropped
with '[ ]'.


Fixed following bug (also in R-3.3.0):

  > f <- function (...) ..2
  > f(1,,2)

  > g <- function (a,b,c) b
  > g(1,,2)
  Error in g(1, , 2) : argument "b" is missing, with no default

Call of f should also produce an error.  But this bug fix has been
reverted, because it leads to make check failing (problem with NextMethod).


Fixed the following bug (also in R-3.3.0):

  > f <- function (...) ..1; f()
  Error in f() : 'nthcdr' needs a list to CDR down

The error is now "Error in f() : The ... list does not contain 1 elements".
