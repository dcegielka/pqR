Implements '_' as an explicit missing value, and its
use to signal that a diminsion should not be dropped
with '[ ]'.

Fixed following bug (also in R-3.3.0):

  > f <- function (...) ..2
  > f(1,,2)

  > g <- function (a,b,c) b
  > g(1,,2)
  Error in g(1, , 2) : argument "b" is missing, with no default

Call of f should also produce an error.
