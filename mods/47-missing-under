Implements '_' as an explicit missing value, and its
use to signal that a diminsion should not be dropped
with '[ ]'.


Fixed the following bug (also in R-3.3.0):

  > f <- function (...) ..2
  > f(1,,2)

  > g <- function (a,b,c) b
  > g(1,,2)
  Error in g(1, , 2) : argument "b" is missing, with no default

Call of f should also produce an error.  But this bug fix has been
reverted, because it leads to make check failing (problem with NextMethod).


Fixed the following bug (also in R-3.3.0):

  > f <- function (...) ..1; f()
  Error in f() : 'nthcdr' needs a list to CDR down

The error is now "Error in f() : The ... list does not contain 1 elements".


Fixed the following bug (also in R-3.3.0):

  f <- function (x) { try(x); missing(x) }
  g <- function (y) f(y)
  h <- function (z) g(z)

  f(pi[1,1])  # FALSE
  g(pi[1,1])  # FALSE
  h(pi[1,1])  # TRUE - but shouldn't be!


Now no longer use PRSEEN in R_isMissing (needed to fix bug above, and 
to do missing_from_underline properly).


Added tests of missing and missing_from_underline to eval-etc.R.
