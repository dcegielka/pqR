New approach to ISNAN, ISNA, etc.  Assumes IEEE floating point double
corresponds to 64-bit int in consistent endian way.  Implements these
as static inline functions on that basis, using union.  No longer any
need for ENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK, since this should work on all current
processors (any with consistent endianness).
