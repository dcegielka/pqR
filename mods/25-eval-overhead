Changes to reduce overhead in eval.

Splits evalv into small part that handles constants
that calls larger part (evalv2).

Creates and uses dotdotdot_error to move some code
out of eval (and elsewhere) to make for more compact code.

Changes applyClosure and its calls so that no supplied environment is
indicated by NULL, not R_NilValue or R_BaseEnv.  The use of the latter
worked only because of peculiarities of the present implementation of
the base environemnt.
