Changes to reduce overhead in eval.

Splits evalv into small part that handles constants
that calls larger part (evalv2).

Creates and uses dotdotdot_error to move some code
out of eval (and elsewhere) to make for more compact code.
Also, same for unbound_var_error and arg_missing_error.

Changes applyClosure and its calls so that no supplied environment is
indicated by NULL, not R_NilValue or R_BaseEnv.  The use of the latter
worked only because of peculiarities of the present implementation of
the base environemnt.
