Changes to whether BLAS is used to do matrix multiplies, to mimic R
Core behaviour so far as it makes any sense at all.

Changes configure.ac to be more explicit about BLAS/LAPACK.

Changes R-admin to stop falsely claiming that vecLib is the default on
OS X.  More changes as well.

Takes vecLibg95c.c from R-2.15.2, for change to accommodate recent 
OS X versions.

Replaces configuration options --disable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-in-helpers
and --disable-mat-mult-in-BLAS-by-default by setting of variables
BLAS_in_helpers and mat_mult_in_BLAS.
