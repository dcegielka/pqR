Changes to whether BLAS is used to do matrix multiplies, to mimic R
Core behaviour so far as it makes any sense at all.

Changes configure.ac to be more explicit about BLAS/LAPACK.

Changes R-admin to stop falsely claiming that vecLib is the default on
OS X.  More changes needed.

Also renames the --disable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-in-helpers
configuration option to --disable-BLAS-in-helpers.
