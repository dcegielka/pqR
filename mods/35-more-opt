More optimizations.

Use installed_already and forcePromise in methods_list_dispatch.

Got rid of the conditional use of the global cache (now always used),
since it gets silly maintaining the alternative (which is never tested).

Got rid of conditional use of fast base cache lookup.

Revised findFun and FINDFUN.

Created and used integer_to_string function - sprintf seems very slow.
