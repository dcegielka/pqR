Various mods, mostly motivated by desire to improve checking.

Set an unset random seed from the R_SEED environment variable, if it
exists (otherwise from time and process id as before).  Allows for
reproducible checks of packages without changing them.

Rdiff now ignores valgrind output when doing a comparison.  The Rdiff
command unsets R_DEBUGGER so that it won't produce valgrind output
itself if R_DEBUGGER was set to valgrind.
