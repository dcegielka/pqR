Various mods, motivated by compatibility, desire to improve checking, etc.

Minor cleanups (eg, remove unused variables).

Set an unset random seed from the R_SEED environment variable, if it
exists (otherwise from time and process id as before).  Allows for
reproducible checks of packages without changing them.

Rdiff now ignores valgrind output when doing a comparison.  The Rdiff
command unsets R_DEBUGGER so that it won't produce valgrind output
itself if R_DEBUGGER was set to valgrind.

Creation of a matrix with diag is now compatibile with R-3.1.0 w.r.t.
expressions like diag(list(2,3,1)).
