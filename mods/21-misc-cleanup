Miscellaneous mods for minor speedups, code cleanliness, or bugs.

Slightly sped up evalcount updates in eval.c

Slight cosmetic changes to license(), plus pqR URL added, plus fixed
wrong file name.

Changes to model.frame, na.omit, na.exclude, that clean up code
and fix bug that na.omit of a data frame with zero rows has one row.
Also fixed by R-core (with slightly different code) (PR 15399) in
R-3.0.2.

Removed redundant (I hope) initial setting of R_Visible from primitive
data in evalv, and slightly sped up final setting.  Did same for .Internal
(in names.c).

Changed creation of assignment symbols in applydefine to use predefined
symbols rather than look at printname.

Fixed performance problem in logic.c and summary.c from PR 15798
(differently from fix by R Core).  Wider implications addressed elsewhere.

Now use Seql for exact comparison in get1index.

Sped up Rf_length for pairlists.

+logical now converts to integer.

Use copy_3_strings in cross_colon.  Document before its definition that
R_AllocStringBuffer allocates an extra byte for the terminating null
(apparently not realized by someone who updated cross_colon in R-3.0.1).

Be more cautious in SET_VECTOR_ELEMENT_FROM_VECTOR.  Probably was a
bug there, though can't so far construct an example due to namedcnt getting
incremented for other reasons.

Added vmaxget/set in numeric_deriv (as in later R Core releases).
