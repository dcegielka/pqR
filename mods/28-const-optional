Make constant objects be actual read-only constants only optionally
Was thought to perhaps be the source of the problem with RStudio,
but seems it was't.  But code is still kept, with the option for
constant objects to be read-only currently enabled.

The real problem with RStudio seems to be that R_NilValue, R_EmptyEnv,
and R_UnboundValue are no longer variables.  This is now fixed, with
them being declared as variables before being redefined as macros
in Rinternals.h, and initialized as variables after being undefined
in const-objs.c.

There are also other cleanups to do with constant objects.
