More improvements to dotcode.c

Duplicates scalars only when they change.

Fixes possible protection bug in do_dotCode.

Implements parallel execution in helper threads, in some circumstances.

Updates help(.C) to reflect mods.

Allows character arguments with DUP=FALSE, duplicating them anyway.

Rationalizes the "checkTypes" code in do_dotCode, which made no sense
(had code to coerce which apparently could not possibly be executed).
Enables registration with type checking for str_signif, with ANYSXP
for the first argument (which previously failed).
