Miscellaneous fixes.

Fix to methods_list_dispatch.c that caused make check-all failure
in no-segfault test on Windows 10 (pqR issue #29 + related fix).

Fixed bug illustrated by 

     atan; show<-function(x)cat("HI\n"); atan

Put in check for non-existent primitives when unserializing, from R-3.0.1.

Fixed problem with identifying makeinfo version in later versions.

Fixed problems in do_set that led to unnecessary waiting for computations 
to finish.

Fixed problem with pqR sometimes hanging when helpers_trace enabled and
then output is interrupted.  Now uses REprintf for helpers_printf rather
than Rprintf, which seems to not check for user interrupts.

Also changed R_CheckUserInterrupt to not do R_CHECKSTACK if interrupts
are supposed to be suspended.
