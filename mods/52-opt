Performance optimization / tuning.  (Also, a bit of general cleanup of
comments, etc., and one extension.)


Got rid of saving of R_EvalDepth in eval, in favour of increment/decrement.
It's saved and restored in/from contexts anyway.

Put a selection of global variables that are frequently used into a
structure to ensure reference locality (and possibly allow the
compiler to address faster).

Eliminate save/restore of R_Srcref in eval, do when modified elsewhere
instead.  It's already saved in contexts for restoration on longjump.

Introduced R_EVAL_TWEAKS, which may be defined by a compiler argument,
to control which tweaks concerning eval are enabled.

Now allow R_CStackDir to be a constant, defined by a compiler
argument, rather than determined at run-time initialization.  Now
assume downwards growth, though this can be overridden.  Code for
run-time check has been kept, but is currently never used.

Changed how R_Visible is handled, updating R-ints.texi to explain new
scheme.  This change reduces overhead in eval.


For merge reasons, this branch also implements a change to allow things
like "a"[3] <- 2, for consistency with "a" <- 2 being allowed.
