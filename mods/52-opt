Performance optimization / tuning.

Changed how eval relates to evalv (with tuning #if).

Got rid of saving of R_EvalDepth in eval, in favour of increment/decrement.
It's saved and restored in/from contexts anyway.

Put the following global variables that are frequently used into a
structure to ensure reference locality (and possibly allow the
compiler to address faster):

   R_variant_result
   R_Visible
   R_EvalDepth
   R_Expressions
   evalcount (was local to eval.c)
   R_PPStackSize
   R_PPStack
   R_PPStackTop
   R_CStackDir
   R_CStackLimit
   R_CStackThreshold
