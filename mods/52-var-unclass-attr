Implements a variant result (from VARIANT_UNCLASS) in which a class
attribute can still be present even though not supposed to be there
(eg, from unclass).  

Also a variant result (VARIANT_ANY_ATTR) in which any attributes may
(or may not) be returned, because their presence or absence will be
ignored by the caller anyway.  And a variant result (VARIANT_ANY_ATTR_EX_DIM)
like this excep that the dim attriute must be correct.

Use these in do_for, do_sum, do_prod, and do_length, do_subset3.

Pay attention to VARIANT_UNCLASS in unclass.

Pay attention to VARIANT_ANY_ATTR and VARIANT_ANY_ATTR_EX_DIM in math1.

Pay attention to VARIANT_ANY_ATTR in do_arith.

Added tests for this to assignperf.R
