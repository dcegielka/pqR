Change how helpers are done in relation to startup of R - rather than
have helpers_startup called in mainloop, with helpers_master calling
setup_Rmainloop and then run_Rmainloop, have helpers_startup be called
inside run_Rmainloop.  This accommodates programs that don't call
mainloop, but call setup_Rmainloop and run_Rmainloop themselves.

Also restores the replDLL stuff for embedded applications, rewritten
for revised scheme in main.c.  Adds a test of this to tests/Embedding.
