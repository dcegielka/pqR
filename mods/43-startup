Change how helpers are done in relation to startup of R - rather than
have helpers_startup called in mainloop, with helpers_master calling
setup_Rmainloop and then run_Rmainloop, have helpers_startup be called
inside run_Rmainloop.  This accommodates programs that don't call
mainloop, but call setup_Rmainloop and run_Rmainloop themselves.

Also restores the replDLL stuff for embedded applications, rewritten
for revised scheme in main.c.  Adds a test of this to tests/Embedding,
based on a rewriting of an example in R-exts.texi, which had several
errors.  Also, R_ReplDLLinit called SETJMP, which received a LONGJMP
after it had returned, which is definitely a no-no.  A better version
is implemented.  Changed rtest in gnuwin32/front-ends as well.

Changed the build process so that setting R_NO_BASE_COMPILE to FALSE
(as well as to an empty string or to nothing) means packages are byte
compiled.

Also makes more mods for Windows.  Changes how optimization levels are
set.  Introduced -mstackrealign when -msse2 is used to bypass problem
that gcc assumes greater alignment than Windows provides on startup.

Better documentation on Windows installation in gnuwin32/INSTALL,
with separate MkRules.dist32, MkRules.dist32-sse2, and MkRules.dist64.

Documentation changes as well, regarding embedding, Windows, etc.

Kludged helpers.c to bypass problem with omp.h in Rtools.

Fixed a problem in src/gnuwin32 with psignalc and psignal.h, where
"int" was used where "sigset_t" was needed.

Adds some fixes and other things for Windows from later R Core
versions.

Fixed ctrl-C problem only partially fixed by R Core.  In the 
process, split Rfe into Rfe (for R) and Rscriptfe (for RScript),
which is cleaner.

Add warning about OpenMP threads not having long double arithmetic.
