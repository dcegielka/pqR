Change how helpers are done in relation to startup of R - rather than
have helpers_startup called in mainloop, with helpers_master calling
setup_Rmainloop and then run_Rmainloop, have helpers_startup be called
inside run_Rmainloop.  This accommodates programs that don't call
mainloop, but call setup_Rmainloop and run_Rmainloop themselves.

Also restores the replDLL stuff for embedded applications, rewritten
for revised scheme in main.c.  Adds a test of this to tests/Embedding,
based on a rewriting of an example in R-exts.texi, which had several
errors.  Also, R_ReplDLLinit called SETJMP, which received a LONGJMP
after it had returned, which is definitely a no-no.  A better version
is implemented.

Changed the build process so that setting R_NO_BASE_COMPILE to FALSE
(as well as to an empty string or to nothing) means packages are byte
compiled.

Also makes more mods for Windows.  Change optimization level to O2
rather than O3, since the compiler seems to buggy at O3 when
architecture is set to native (on a sandy bridge machine).

Documentation changes as well, regarding embedding, Windows, etc.
