Modifications to do_set and applydefine for complex assignments.

Also, added a codePromises option for deparse, and NA option for
evaluate in dump, which goes with these being needed for better
error display in the new scheme.

Make deparsing for errors use the new codePromises option.  Changed
all the primitive replacement functions (eg, length<-, environment<-,
[<-, [[<-, $<-) to use errorcall, and otherwise ratiionalized error
handling in various places.  Modified "try" to use the codePromises
option for deparsing.

Updated the saved output of reg-tests-2.Rout and reg-tests-1b.Rout
to show new error messages.
