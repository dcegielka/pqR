Eliminate parentheses from the abstract syntax tree for expressions
that are the operands of binary or unary operands, when the
parentheses are not redundant (and hence will be put in by the
deparser).

Made slight modification to a test in the 'codetools' recommended
package to accomodate the removal of parens.
