Defines a NOT_LVALUE macro that disallows use on the left side
of an assignment, and uses it to make the macros for CAR, CDR, 
etc. safe from assignment bypassing the old-to-new check even
when USE_RINTERNALS is defined.  

Also fixes two uses of this that recent mods had introduced.

These CAR, CDR, etc. macros, along with LENGTH, TYPEOF, and
inline functions for REAL, etc. are now also used in packages, 
avoiding procedure call overhead for these operations.  Error
checking as before is maintained.
