Defines a NOT_LVALUE macro that disallows use on the left side
of an assignment, and uses it to make the macros for CAR, CDR, 
etc. safe from assignment bypassing the old-to-new check even
when USE_RINTERNALS is defined.  

Also fixes two uses of this that recent mods had introduced.

These functions along with REAL, etc. are now defined as static inline
functions for user code, avoiding procedure call overhead for these
operations.  Error checking as before is maintained.
