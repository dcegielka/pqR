Modifications to complex assignment code (the "applydefine" function).

Simplifies code by getting rid of VARIANT_MUST_COPY, and removing
unnecessary duplication in applydefine.  

Fixes the following bug (and related bugs):

  a <- list(list(1+1))
  b <- a
  attr(a[[1]][[1]],"fred")<-9
  print(b)

Gets rid of duplicate in EnsureLocal.  This needs some mods in other
places: length<- and slot assignment for S4 methods.

Cleans up and speeds up length<- as well.
